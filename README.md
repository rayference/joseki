This package gathers together datasets of thermophysical properties of the
Earth's atmosphere relevant for radiative transfer applications, and provides
utilities to compute common characteristic quantities and perform operations
such as interpolation and rescaling on a dataset.

## Features

* Available profiles:
  * *AFGL Atmospheric Constituent Profiles (0-120 km)*
  * *MIPAS (2007) reference atmospheres*
  * *U.S. Standard Atmosphere, 1976*
* NetCDF support thanks to the [xarray](https://xarray.pydata.org) library
* Documented and standard dataset format based on the
  [CF conventions](https://cfconventions.org)
* Dataset schema validation
* Altitude interpolation/extrapolation and regularization
* Molecular concentration rescaling
* Molecules selection
* Computation of derived quantities
* Convenient units support thanks to the [pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io)
  library
* Command-line interface
* Python API

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+

## Ikigai

*Joseki* was born in the context of the development of the
[Eradiate](https://github.com/eradiate/eradiate) radiative transfer model, from
the need to collect, document and trace, integrate and modify *popular*
thermophysical profiles.
As such, its features evolve in close relationship to those of *Eradiate*.

## About

Joseki was created by [Yvan Nollet](https://github.com/nollety) and is maintained by [Rayference](https://www.rayference.eu).

Joseki is a component of the [Eradiate radiative transfer model](https://www.eradiate.eu/site/).

Joseki's logo is a simple representation (not to scale!) of the 5 layers of
Earth's atmosphere (troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere and
exosphere).
