# How-to guides

## Quickstart

Make an atmospheric profile using the function :meth:`joseki.make`.
Use its `identifier` parameter to specify the atmospheric profile.
For example, make the *AFGL (1986) US Standard* profile with:

```python
import joseki

ds = joseki.make(identifier="afgl_1986-us_standard")
```


Display the available identifiers with:

```python
from joseki.profiles import factory

list(factory.registry.keys())
```

If you want, you can save the data set to the disk as a NetCDF file:

```python
ds.to_netcdf("my_data_set.nc")
```

Open the data set again using `xarray.open_dataset`:

```python
import xarray as xr

ds = xr.open_dataset("my_data_set.nc")
```

The data sets format is described [here](explanation.md#data-set-format).

## Cells representation

To make an atmospheric profile where data variables are given in altitude cells
instead of at altitude levels, set the parameter `represent_in_cells` to
`True`:

```python
ds = joseki.make(
    identifier="afgl_1986-us_standard",
    represent_in_cells=True,
)
```

The resulting data set has a coordinate variable `z` that corresponds to
the altitude cells center and a data variable `z_bounds` that indicate the
altitude bounds of each altitude cell, i.e. atmospheric layer.

## Advanced options

The collection of atmospheric profiles defined by
`Anderson1986AtmosphericConstituentProfiles` includes volume mixing
ratio data for 28 molecules, where molecules 8-28 are described as *additional*.
By default, these additional molecules are included in the atmospheric profile.
To discard these additional molecules, set the `additional_molecules`
parameter to `False`:

```python
ds = joseki.make(
    identifier="afgl_1986-us_standard",
    represent_in_cells=True,
    additional_molecules=False,
)
```

The resulting data set now includes only 7 molecules, instead of 28.

## Derived quantities

You can compute various derived quantities from a thermophysical properties
data set produced by `joseki`:

* the column number density of each molecule in the data set.

  Example:

  ```python
  ds = joseki.make(identifier="afgl_1986-us_standard")
  ds.joseki.column_number_density["O3"].to("dobson_unit")
  ```

* the column mass density of each molecule in the data set

  Example:

  ```python
   ds.joseki.column_mass_density["H2O"]
   ```

* the number density at sea level of each molecule in the data set

  Example:

   ```
   ds.joseki.number_density_at_sea_level["CO2"]
   ```

* the mass density at sea level of each molecule in the data set

  Example:

  ```python
   ds.joseki.mass_density_at_sea_level["CH4"]
   ```

For further details on these methods, refer to the :ref:`API reference<api_reference>`.

### Rescaling

You can modify the amount of a given set of molecules in your thermophysical
properties data set by applying a rescale transformation:

```python
ds = joseki.make(identifier="afgl_1986-us_standard")
ds.joseki.rescale(
   factors={
      "H2O": 0.5,
      "CO2": 1.5,
      "CH4": 1.1,
   }
)
```

In the example above, the amount of water vapor is halfed whereas the amount of
carbon dioxide and methane is increased by 150% and 110%, respectively.
When a rescale transformation has been applied to a data set, its ``rescaled``
attribute is set to ``True`` and its ``history`` attribute is updated to
indicate what scaling factors were applied to what molecules.
If the scaling factors are such that the volume fractions sum is larger than
1.0 at any altitude, an error is raised.

```python
ds = joseki.make(identifier="afgl_1986-us_standard")
ds.joseki.rescale(
   factors={
      "O2": 2.0,  # invalid
   }
)
```

When executed, the above code will raise a ``ValueError`` because the scaling
factor is invalid.

!!! danger "Warning"

    For some profiles of the `afgl_1986-*` series, namely
    `afgl_1986-tropical`, `afgl_1986-midlatitude_summer` and
    `afgl_1986-subarctic_summer`,  a `ValueError` is raised
    while rescaling although the scaling factors are valid.
    For example, the code below:

    ```python

    ds = joseki.make(identifier="afgl_1986-tropical")
    ds.joseki.rescale(
       factors={
          "H2O": 0.5,
       }
    )
    ```

    will raise a `ValueError` with a message indicating that the volume
    mixing ratio sum is larger than one, although all that we did is
    decrease the amount the water vapor by half.

    The reason is, that the volume mixing ratio sum **was** larger than one
    before the rescaling transformation, and the transformation was not
    significant enough to change that.
    The original paper :cite:`Anderson1986AtmosphericConstituentProfiles` does
    not make any comment about the sum of volume fractions being larger than
    one for the mentioned profiles.

    The suggested way to circumvent this issue is to decrease the amount of a
    molecule that is not relevant to your application, e.g. `N2` so that
    the volume fractions sum is less than one, and apply your original
    rescaling transformation:

    ```python
    ds = joseki.make(identifier="afgl_1986-tropical")
    ds.joseki.rescale(
       factors={
           "N2": 0.99,
           "H2O": 0.5,
       }
    )
    ```

    where the value of the scaling factor for `N2` may have to be adjusted
    depending on your rescaling transformation.


### Plotting

!!! note "Note"

   For plotting, you will need to install the
   `https://matplotlib.org <matplotlib library>`_.

You can easily make a plot of any of the four variables of a dataset, i.e.,
air pressure (``p``), air temperature (``t``), air number density (``n``) or
volume mixing ratio (``x``):

``` python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

ds = joseki.make(
   identifier="afgl_1986-us_standard",
   additional_molecules=False
)

ds.p.plot(
   figsize=(4, 8),
   ls="dotted",
   marker=".",
   y="z",
   xscale="log",
)
plt.show()
```

```python
ds.t.plot(
   figsize=(4, 8),
   ls="dotted",
   marker=".",
   y="z",
   xscale="linear",
)
plt.show()
```

![image](fig/user_guide/plotting-t.png)

```python
ds.n.plot(
   figsize=(4, 8),
   ls="dotted",
   marker=".",
   y="z",
   xscale="log",
)
plt.show()
```

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))

for m in ds.joseki.molecules:
    ds[f"x_{m}"].plot(
        ls="dotted",
        marker=".",
        y="z",
        xscale="log",
    )

plt.xlabel("volume fraction [dimensionless]")
plt.legend(ds.joseki.molecules)
plt.show()
```
